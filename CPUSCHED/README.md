## Description

This program will act as a CPU scheduler and handle scheduling 500 simulated processes. The user will choose which
scheduling algorithm to handle the processes: FIFO, SJF without preemption, Priority with preemption



## Input file

The program takes an input text file titled 


## Compiling the program

Starting from the source code, the program can be compiled 


## Running the program

The program can be run in Terminal using the following command:


## The program can be run in Terminal using the folLowing command:



## Output

The output files have the following structure: "output - [ Scheduling Type ].txt", such as:

Output-FIFOScheduling.txt

Output-PriorityScheduling.txt

Output-SJFScheduling.txt

Each output file will have the following contents:


## Result's summary and explanation


Throughput = total number of processes/total elapsed time

CPU utilization = total burst time/total time elapsed time
